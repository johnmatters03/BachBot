* A summary of your project
abstract:
370 Bach chorales were parsed and put in a modified symbol table,
based on user input the program then generates random chord progressions based on the symbol table.
The result is outputted through jMusic in both display and audio. I implemented a class to parse Kern files,
a class to generate/analyze Markov chains, a class to store the Markov chain, and a client.
